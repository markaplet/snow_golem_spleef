## Fun Fact
This game was originally conceived by my 5 year old son. Not as a mini game but just something he thought was fun to do in vanilla Minecraft. I created a small arena and saved it with structure blocks so we could instantly reset the game. This command block version has been expanded for no reason other than to make it more fair. (At 5, my son is not so great with rules, or instructions to play fairly.)
